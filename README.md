# messengerTemplate
This is a messenger template that I made by myself using only HTML and CSS. I'm a beginner right now.
The buttons help, about and other buttons don't work, I could make them but it's only a template training, and I also don't know JS that much to do that.
However, I could create the other pages if I'd like.
